With Twitter's recent rebranding to X, this platform now has the largest user base ever for limitless interactivity.
In homage to the iconic bird, I ventured to construct my own social network. Armed with Android development and the elegance of Kotlin, I harnessed the Firebase APIs as the backbone of my network's infrastructure. This enabled seamless user management, login and signout functionalities, user profiles, tweets and retweets, home activities, and fragment screens. 


**The UI of the app has been updated in v2 according to the UI of Twitter's Android app v7.24.1**
** The dependencies have been updated and the project has been migrated to AndroidX in November 2020. **
