# X Clone
With Twitter's recent rebranding to X, this platform now has the largest user base ever for limitless interactivity.
In homage to the iconic bird, I ventured to construct my own social network. Armed with the prowess of Android development and the elegance of Kotlin, I harnessed the mighty Firebase APIs as the backbone of my network's infrastructure. This enabled seamless user management, encompassing the realms of login and signout functionalities, user profiles, the orchestration of tweets and retweets, the captivating mosaic of home activities, and a medley of fragment screens. My creation encompasses a plethora of typical Twitter features, including tweets, hashtags, likes, retweets, follows, and news feeds, all seamlessly interwoven into the fabric of my digital masterpiece.

Let's delve into the technological marvels that underpin this endeavour:

1. Authentication

- Create a new user by using the Firebase Authentication service, and then use the CometChat SDK to create a new CometChat user.
